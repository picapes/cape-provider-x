# 4.0.2
* Fixed: `$` inside `fabric.mod.json` is usually replaced by the build process #145
  * Added a note that this may require escaping using a `\`
  * Made it possible to use `§` instead of `$`
    * Updated the demo accordingly

# 4.0.1
* Made animated GIF decoding more reliable
  * This should fix broken textures #135
* The maximum size for image downloads is now 10MB by default

# 4.0.0

  * For further details please have a look at the corresponding documentation on the README
* Various small code improvements

# 3.0.0
* Other mods can now define cape providers in their metadata #94
  * This way other developers don't have to manually implement/copy-paste code for adding custom capes (e.g. for supporters) which should result in less conflicts
  * Cape providers loaded from other mod's metadata are automatically loaded and activated by default
    * This can be changed in the settings under ``Other > Providers from mods``
  * Usage example:
    * Simple implementation:<br/>
      ``fabric.mod.json``
      ```json5
      {
        ...
        "custom": {
          "cape": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litetex-oss/mcm-cape-provider/refs/heads/dev/custom-cape-demo/uuid.png"
        }
      }
      ```
    * More detailed variant:<br/>
      ``fabric.mod.json``
      ```json5
      {
        "custom": {
          "cape": {
            // Gives everyone a christmas cape
            // You can also use variables here, like $uuid. See above for more details
            // Alternative: "uriTemplate"
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litetex-oss/mcm-cape-provider/refs/heads/dev/custom-cape-demo/uuid.png",
            "changeCapeUrl": "https://...",
            "rateLimitedReqPerSec": 20
          }
        }
      }
      ```
